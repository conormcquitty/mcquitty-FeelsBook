Assumptions & Explanations:

Exception handling is present for an incorrectly entered date string. 
It is not present for a comment that is too long, as that is handled in my xml file activity_edit_emotions.xml
Here I specify that the EditText can not be any longer than 100 characters with the line 
android:maxLength="100".
